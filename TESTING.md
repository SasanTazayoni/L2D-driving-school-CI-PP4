## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

As my project uses Jinja syntax, such as `{% for loops %}`, `{% url 'home' %}`, and `{{ variable|filter }}` it will not validate properly if I copy and paste into the HTML validator straight from my source files. In order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to [validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Some of the pages on this site require a user to be logged-in and authenticated and will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have access to login to the pages. In these cases the following steps have to be taken:

* Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication.
* Right-click on the page and select View Page Source (usually `CTRL+U` or `⌘+U` on Mac).
* This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
* Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
* Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

## Browser Compatibility

I've tested my deployed project on multiple browsers to check for compatibility issues.

| Browser | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Chrome | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/browser-test-chrome.png) | Works as expected |
| Edge | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/browser-test-edge.png) | Works as expected |
| Firefox | ![screenshot](documentation/testing/browser-test-firefox.png) | Works as expected |

I have also used PowerMapper as a tool to check the compatibility of the website on multiple browsers and it has proven that it works on all of the most commonly used devices:

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal:

`python3 manage.py test`
